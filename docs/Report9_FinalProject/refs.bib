    abstract = "{The compressibility of reservoir rock is a factor which is generally neglected in reservoir engineering calculations. This is due in part to the fact that there is little published information on rock compressibility values for limestones and sandstones. Omission of rock compressibility is undoubtedly justified in calculations for saturated reservoirs; however, in undersaturated reservoirs, expansion of the rock accompanying decline in the reservoir pressure may be of such magnitude as to affect materially the prediction of reservoir performance. The effect of rock compressibility will be of most importance in:calculation of oil in place by pressure decline data in undersaturated volumetric reservoirs when the limits of the field are unknown or indefinite, and studies of natural water drive performance.To estimate its importance in such cases, a series of laboratory tests were made to obtain usable values for reservoir rock compressibility.The total, or effective, compressibility of any reservoir rock is a result of two separate factors, namely, expansion of the individual rock grains, as the surrounding fluid pressure decreases, and the additional formation compaction brought about because the reservoir fluids become less effective in opposing the weight of the overburden as reservoir pressure declines. Both of these factors tend to decrease porosity. The laboratory tests were conducted in a manner that would give compressibility values representing a combination of the two factors, and would, as nearly as possible, duplicate the behavior of the rock under reservoir conditions. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the equipment used to determine rock compressibility. The rocks used in these tests were cores cut from producing limestone and sandstone formations. They were from 2 to 3 1/2 in. in diameter, and 5 to 6 in.long. A core to be tested was completely surrounded by a Lucite jacket with the exception of the connection at one end to allow production of liquid during testing. To represent the effect of the overburden, a constant external hydrostatic pressure of 3,000 psig was applied to the core throughout the test.(The amount of external pressure was varied in a series of tests and no change was evidenced in the measured compressibility values.) Starting at approximately 1,500 psi static fluid pressure in the core, the core pressure was reduced by steps of 100 to 200 psi. Precise measurement of liquid production was made for each decrease in pressure.T.N. 149}",

    abstract = "{The pore-volume compressibilities and porosities presented here were derived from 256 samples of sandstone and limestone representing 40 reservoirs. These and previously published data are in poor agreement with compressibility-porosity correlations in the literature. The salient conclusion is that to evaluate rock compressibility for a given reservoir it is necessary to measure compressibility in the laboratory.The use of pore-volume compressibility-porosity correlations in engineering calculations is well known. The correlations developed by Hall for both sandstones and limestones have been widely distributed. Van der Knaap published a similar correlation using limestone samples from a single well and also correlated the data with net pressure. Such correlations are attractive because of the simple relationship established. However, those correlations were intended only for well consolidated samples; correlations for friable or unconsolidated samples have not been published. This study compares our laboratory data with the published correlations of consolidated samples as published correlations of consolidated samples as well as with values for friable and unconsolidated sandstones. Compressibility values are presented for 256 rock samples from 40 reservoirs - 197 samples from 29 sandstone reservoirs and 59 samples from 11 limestone reservoirs. Porosities ranged from less than 1 percent to 35 percent. Compressibility values from the literature for 79 samples are added, including Hall's and Van der Knaap's.To obtain a representative sample of a formation for testing, one must avoid grain rearrangement. This problem is unlikely to occur with consolidated problem is unlikely to occur with consolidated samples or friable samples containing some cementation, although the effect of removing the overburden is still unknown. Unconsolidated samples, on the other hand, present a much more complex problem, in that grain rearrangement is very likely during either coring or subsequent handling. The advent of the rubber-sleeve core barrel much improved the chances of obtaining, representative samples. We have some evidence that, if carefully handled. rubber-sleeve cores will provide reasonably undisturbed samples. However, even if the sand is captured undisturbed in the rubber sleeve, internal gas can expand the core during the trip to the surface. The history of all the samples used in this study is not complete, but most of the unconsolidated samples were obtained from rubber-sleeve cores.Preparing the Samples Preparing the Samples The consolidated and friable samples used in this study were generally plugs 1 in. in diameter and 3 in. long, and their condition ranged from well preserved to dry and weathered. The core plugs were extracted in solvent to remove water and hydrocarbons, put into a flexible jacket, and saturated with a refined oil. The unconsolidated samples of about the same dimensions were generally cored from rubber-sleeve cores that had been frozen in liquid nitrogen and for which liquid nitrogen had been used as a drilling fluid. The frozen samples were placed in a Teflon sleeve and allowed to thaw. End plates and screens were then placed on the ends of the samples.JPTP. 129}",

abstract = {A method for measuring emulsion viscosity under pressurized (1–100 bar) and temperature-controlled flow conditions is described. It makes use of a flow simulator shaped as a hollow wheel. As the wheel is rotating, the liquid inside will have a relative motion in the opposite direction of the rotation. The torque acting on the wheel shaft is measured and transformed, via a calibration model, into the viscosity of the fluid. The method has been applied to water-in-oil emulsions with several live North Sea crude oils with saturation pressures up to 100 bar and water cuts in the range 0–90%. The method is shown to be a useful way of obtaining estimates of emulsion viscosity for live oil systems in a relatively small scale apparatus. Even though the crude oils studied were rather different and had very different viscosities, the relative viscosities as a function of water cut up to at least 60% showed small variation and might be represented by a general ‘master curve’. The relative viscosities obtained experimentally have been compared to a temperature-dependent Richardson-type correlation [Rønningsen, H.P., 1995. Correlations for predicting viscosity of W/O-emulsions based on North Sea crude oils. Proc. SPE Int. Symp. Oil Field Chem., Houston, TX, USA, SPE 28968], and three other correlations proposed by Mooney [J. Colloid Sci. 6 (1951) 162], Pal and Rhodes [J. Rheol. 337 (1989) 1021] (P&R) and Pal [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 231 (2000) 168], respectively. Overall, when being tuned to measured data, the P&R correlation gives the best match, closely followed by the Mooney correlation, but for low and medium water cuts, the Rønningsen correlation is comparable. This correlation does not require any measurements for tuning. Although it may be slightly conservative at low to medium water cuts, and somewhat optimistic at very high water cuts, for practical purposes in design of flow lines, it provides a reasonably accurate first estimate of the effective liquid phase viscosity. The recent correlation of Pal [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 231 (2000) 168] was found to be extremely sensitive to the choice of tuning point and, thus, to be rather inaccurate either at low water cuts or high water cuts.}

abstract = {Phase inversion and its effect on pressure gradient during the dispersed flow of two immiscible liquids have been studied for two pipe materials (steel and acrylic) and two pipe sizes (60 and 32 mm ID). Water and oil (796 kgm−3 density and 2.19 mm2s−1 viscosity) were used as test fluids while the appearance of phase inversion in the acrylic pipes was confirmed with the use of impedance ring probes. In the large pipes (steel and acrylic with 60 mm ID) it was found that the phase inversion point (oil volume fraction where inversion appears) depended on whether the inversion was from oil to water continuous mixture or from water to oil. The difference in the phase inversion points between the two dispersion initialisation conditions increased with increasing mixture velocity. No effect of initial conditions on the inversion point was found for the small acrylic pipe. Phase inversion was in all cases preceded by a large increase in pressure gradient, which was sharply reduced immediately after the new continuous phase was established. The pressure gradient peak was sharper and larger at high mixture velocities than at low ones and in the acrylic pipe compared to the steel one. The change in phase continuity lasted a few minutes and was accompanied by large fluctuations in pressure gradient and mixture impedance.}

Pressure drop, flow rate, input water fraction, in-situ holdup, mixture temperature, and flow pattern data were obtained for 612 oil-water tests in 1.5-in. pipe, and 587 tests in 1-in. pipe. Oils with viscosities of 4.7, 58, 84, and 115 cp were used in the 1.5-in. runs, while the 1-in. tests used 237-cp and 2116-cp oils, all measured at 70 °F. Mixture velocities varied from 1.5 to 12 ft/s, while input water fractions ranged from 0.05 to 0.90, and mixture temperatures were between 50 and 98 °F.A new correlation is proposed for the prediction of the inversion point of an oil-water dispersion. It was found that the input water fraction required to invert the dispersion decreases with increasing oil viscosity. Pressure drop due to friction was also found to increase abruptly when the flowing oil-water mixture reached the inversion point where the external phase inverted from water to oil.Two pressure-gradient prediction models are presented; one for stratified, and the other for homogeneously dispersed oil-water flows. Comparison between model predictions and experimental data shows satisfactory agreement.Experimental oil-water flow pattern maps were developed. The existing flow pattern in an oil-water mixture depends primarily on mixture velocity, input water fraction, and oil viscosity (only when oil is the external phase).}",

First published in 2003, the petroleum industry has recognized the need for GHG accounting and reporting guidance that is focused specifically on its operations for over a decade. The Guidelines continue to promote credible, consistent, and reliable greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting practices from oil and gas operations.The new edition holds significantly revised chapters on setting boundaries (including discussion of financial control and clearer reference to Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) and the evaluation of industry GHG emissions, including uncertainty. There are also revisions to discussions around reporting emissions over time, de minimis emissions, and normalization. The WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol was, as with the original edition, carefully considered for consistency. The revised Guidelines have also aimed to achieve consistency with the approaches described in the IPIECA publication Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting revised in 2010.For over a decade the petroleum industry has recognized the need for greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting guidance that is focused specifically on its operations. The American Petroleum Institute (API) first published the Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry in April 2001, with a third edition released in August 2009 (API 2009) (referred to as the Compendium). The original edition of the Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions, (referred to as the Guidelines) was issued in December 2003 to fulfil the need for industry guidance focused specifically on the accounting and reporting of GHG emissions at the facility through to the corporate level. Since the original version of the Guidelines was published, GHG emission reporting has become much more widespread. Mandatory reporting of GHG emissions has increased and for companies that are not required to report emissions, or are required to report only for some of their operations, voluntary corporate reporting has also increased.The second edition of the Guidelines (IPIECA 2011) was developed to reflect changing practices, and to continue to promote credible, consistent, and reliable GHG accounting and reporting practices. The development of these Guidelines proceeded in recognition of the large number of existing GHG accounting and reporting approaches. The World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol (WRI/WBCSD 2004), and the International Standards Organisation ISO 14064–1(ISO 2006) standard were carefully considered for the revised Guidelines.The Guidelines have been developed as a complement to the API Compendium of Emissions Methodologies and the IPIECA Sustainability Reporting Guidance (IPIECA 2010). While the Compendium focuses on GHG emissions estimation methodologies for industry sources (how to calculate emissions), the Guidelines primarily address GHG accounting and reporting for the GHG indicators identified in the Sustainability Guidance. Together, these three publications provide a comprehensive set of guidance for the estimation, accounting and reporting of petroleum industry GHG emissions.}",
